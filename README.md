Learning AI in a strategic way
Prioritized AI/ML Mastery Roadmap


ðŸ¥‡ Tier 1 â€“ Core Foundations (Must Master First)
These give you the 80/20 leverage: most of real-world AI work relies on them.
1. Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN)
2. Ensemble Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
3. Neural Networks & Deep Learning Basics
   + Perceptrons, CNNs, RNNs (basic LSTM/GRU), Autoencoders
   + Core training techniques (dropout, batch norm, attention intro)
4. MLOps & Production AI (Fundamentals)
   + Deployment (APIs, Docker, Kubernetes basics)
   + Experiment tracking (MLflow, DVC)
   + Monitoring & versioning
ðŸ‘‰ Why: These are used in 80%+ of applied AI/ML jobs (finance, healthcare, NLP, vision, recommender systems).


ðŸ¥ˆ Tier 2 â€“ Modern Must-Haves
Critical for cutting-edge AI applications and staying relevant.
5. Transformers & Modern Deep Learning (BERT, GPT, Vision Transformers)
6. Generative AI (LLMs, RAG, VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models)
7. Advanced Neural Architectures (seq2seq, attention, residuals, multimodal models)
8. Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, GMM)
ðŸ‘‰ Why: These power todayâ€™s state-of-the-art AI (ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, CLIP, etc.).


ðŸ¥‰ Tier 3 â€“ Advanced/Complementary Skills
Good for depth and specialization.
9. Reinforcement Learning (Advanced) (PPO, A3C, DQN, SAC, Multi-Agent RL)
10. Probabilistic & Bayesian Models (Bayesian Nets, HMM, Gaussian Processes)
11. Advanced Topics
  + Transfer Learning, Few-shot/Zero-shot, Meta-learning
  + Online/Continual/Active Learning
ðŸ‘‰ Why: Needed for robotics, gaming, personalization, uncertainty modeling, but less common in everyday production ML systems.


ðŸ¥„ Tier 4 â€“ Leadership & Ethics (Long-Term Mastery)
Important but not first priority if you want speed.
12. Responsible & Ethical AI (fairness, bias, explainability, privacy, alignment)
13. Full-Scale MLOps (feature stores, automated retraining pipelines, CI/CD for ML)
ðŸ‘‰ Why: Critical for AI leadership and scaling teams, but you should nail technical mastery first.
